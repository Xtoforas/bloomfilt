# Objective:
Youâ€™ll need some kind of bitmap, some hash functions, and a simple way of reading in the dictionary and then the words to check. For the hash function, remember that you can always use something that generates a fairly long hash (such as MD5) and then take your smaller hash values by extracting sequences of bits from the result. On a Unix box you can find a list of words in /usr/dict/words (or possibly in /usr/share/dict/words).
